        <p class="font2 paragraphs2">Vitamins are organic substances, which means they're made by plants or animals. <br>
             Minerals are inorganic elements that come from soil and water, and are absorbed by plants or eaten by animals. <br>
             Your body needs larger amounts of some minerals, such as calcium, to grow and stay healthy. <br>
             Other minerals like chromium, copper, iodine, iron, selenium, and zinc are called trace minerals because you need only very small amounts of them.
             <br><br>
             Vitamins and minerals boost the immune system, support normal growth and development, and help cells and organs do their jobs.<br>
             For example, you've probably heard that carrots are good for your eyes. It's true! Carrots are full of substances called carotenoids <br>
             that your body converts into vitamin A, which helps prevent eye problems.
             <br><br>
             Vitamin K helps blood to clot, so cuts and scrapes stop bleeding quickly. <br>
             You'll find vitamin K in green leafy vegetables, broccoli, and soybeans. <br>
             And to have strong bones, you need to eat foods such as milk, yogurt, and green leafy vegetables, which are rich in the mineral calcium.

                <p class="font2 paragraphs2">
                    <u><strong>Animal-based :</strong></u> lean meats, fish, and poultry are the best choices for getting the nutrients in animal based your body needs.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p class="font2 paragraphs2">
                    <u><strong>Vegetable based :</strong></u>  Fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products are the best choices for getting the nutrients your body needs.<br>
                    you'll find that a glass of milk is a good source of vitamin D, calcium, phosphorous, and potassium. <br> A glass of soda, on the other hand, doesn't have any vitamins or minerals.
                </p>

        </ul>
        <br>
        <p class="font2 paragraphs2">Vitamins and minerals are essential substances that our bodies need to develop and function normally. <br>
             The known vitamins include A, C, D, E, and K, and the B vitamins: thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), <br>
             pyridoxal (B6), cobalamin (B12), biotin, and folate/folic acid. <br>
             A number of minerals are essential for health: calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, chloride, magnesium, iron,<br>
             zinc, iodine, sulfur, cobalt, copper, fluoride, manganese, and selenium. <br>
             The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015-2020 recommends that people should aim to meet their <br>
             nutrient requirements through a healthy eating pattern that includes nutrient-dense forms of foods.
