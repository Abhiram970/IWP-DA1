        <p class="font2 paragraphs2">Carbohydrates, or carbs, are sugar molecules. Along with proteins and fats, carbohydrates are one of three main nutrients found in foods and drinks.

            <br>Your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. Glucose, or blood sugar, is the main source of energy for your body's cells, tissues, and organs. <br>
            Glucose can be used immediately or stored in the liver and muscles for later use.</p>

                    <u><strong>Sugars :</strong></u>They are also called simple carbohydrates because they are in the most basic form.<br> They can be added to foods, such as the sugar in candy, desserts, processed foods, and regular soda.<br>
                    They also include the kinds of sugar that are found naturally in fruits, vegetables, and milk.

                    <u><strong>Starches :</strong></u>  They are complex carbohydrates, which are made of lots of simple sugars strung together. <br>
                    Your body needs to break starches down into sugars to use them for energy. Starches include bread, cereal, and pasta. <br>
                    They also include certain vegetables, like potatoes, peas, and corn.

                    <u><strong>Fiber :</strong></u>  It is also a complex carbohydrate. Your body cannot break down most fibers, <br>
                    so eating foods with fiber can help you feel full and make you less likely to overeat. <br>
                     Diets high in fiber have other health benefits. They may help prevent stomach or intestinal problems, such as constipation. <br>
                      They may also help lower cholesterol and blood sugar. <br> Fiber is found in many foods that come from plants, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, beans, and whole grains.
