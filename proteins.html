        <p class="font2 paragraphs2">Proteins are large, complex molecules that play many critical roles in the body. <br>
             They do most of the work in cells and are required for the structure, function, and regulation of the body's tissues and organs.
                <br><br>
             Proteins are made up of hundreds or thousands of smaller units called amino acids, which are attached to one another in long chains. <br>
             There are 20 different types of amino acids that can be combined to make a protein. <br>
             The sequence of amino acids determines each protein's unique 3-dimensional structure and its specific function.<br>
             Amino acids are coded by combinations of three DNA building blocks (nucleotides), determined by the sequence of genes.
